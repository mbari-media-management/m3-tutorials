    "- __camera_id__: This is the identifier for the _thing_ that collected the video. We use the ROV name, or AUV name, or some other unique id to tag what collected the video.\n",
    "- __video_name__: A single section of video form a dive, may have several representations. A _big_ relatively uncompressed __master__, a slightly more managebly sized __mezzanine__, and one or more highly compressed __proxies__. This name is the catch-all for all versions of the same video. I've been using `rov_name dive_number start_timestamp` as my representation as it's really easy to automate (e.g. `Ventana 3456 20171112T012345Z`), but again, use what makes sense to you.\n",
    "- __uri__: This is typically the URL to your movie. Your movie really should be served off of a web server. If you don't have one, I have a docker container that can do it for you.\n",
    "- __start_timestamp__: This is the moment when the first frame in the video was recorded. Usually, you can extract this from the movies metadata atoms. That is, if you remembered to correctly sync the clock on your movie recorder.\n",
    "- __duration_millis__: This is actually an optional parameter, but it makes your life sooooo much easier if it's included when you register a video. This is the length (duration) of the movie in milliseconds."

    "\n",

    "- __observer__: Who made the annotation. This could be a full name, email, login id, whatever you deem appropriate for your application.\n",
    "- __elapsed_time_millis__: This is the elapsed time from the start of the movie when the annotation occurred. Your video player should be able to give you this information. Note: some applications won't have elapsed_time available. For example, video tapes ... you can use __timecode__ (e.g. `01:23:45:01`) instead. Or real-time annotations, in which case you can use `recorded_timestamp` (e.g. `2017-11-09T01:23:45.01.123Z`). Note, if you have the correct `start_timestamp` (from your media you retrieved above) and `elapsed_time_millis` from your video player, you can calculate the `recorded_timestamp` and include that too. It makes your data _MUCH_ more useful!!"
